## Hi there 👋  

I'm **LunarLaurus** — I make mods, I fix broken mods, and my mods are open source.  

### 🌌 About  
I'm a British developer with over **15 years of Java experience**. I focus on creating and maintaining mods for **Caves of Qud** and other games. 
If I’ve found a broken mod, there’s a good chance I’ve tried to patch it up!  

### 🌈 Contributions  
- **Merge Requests (MRs)** and **Issues** are welcome!  
- If you spot a bug or have an idea for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.  

### 👩‍💻 Resources  
- Check out the individual mod repos for documentation and more details.  
- For questions or feedback, feel free to open a discussion!  

### 🍿 Fun Fact  
Qud is wild, and so is my breakfast.
